**Image Processing - RGB Layer Separation and Image Resizing**

This repository contains functions to process color images in MATLAB. The main function, displayRGB(filename), allows you to display a color image and separately show its red, green, and blue layers. The code also resizes the image by interpolating each color layer to ensure that the larger dimension has 800 pixels while maintaining the aspect ratio.

- Additionally, the repository provides functionality to create a composite image by placing the original image, along with its red, green, and blue layers, into a single image.
  
**Key features include:**
  - RGB layer separation and display
  - Image resizing using cubic interpolation
  - Composite image creation for visual comparison
